# Social Media Advertisement Evaluation


**Graduate School Project**

Read the project instructions below: 

**Main objective:**
Comment on the effectiveness of the three advertisement campaigns by calculating the most appropriate web analytics measures and presenting them in ways you see as most appropriate.

**Questions/objectives that need to be addressed in brief:**
- Do the three campaigns perform differently, and what could these differences mean? What measurements did you use to measure each campaignâ€™s performance?
- Do the users from different platforms behave differently? There were concerns that some platforms struggled at a particular stage of the process, can you find these stages?
- How does performance of users coming via adverts compare with those that came via social media shares? How about those who came to the site directly, or via search engine?
- Which blog converts better? (so that you know you should write more of similar ones in the future)

**Metrics used in analysis**
- Bounce Rate
- Dropout Rate
- Conversion Rate
- Average Clickstream Depth
